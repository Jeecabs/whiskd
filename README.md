# whiskd

Lightweight process wrapper with a TUI status bar. Run, background, attach, and manage long-running commands with automatic log capture.

## Install

Requires Node.js 18+.

### CLI

Install from GitHub:

```sh
npm install -g github:Jeecabs/whiskd
```

After npm publish, install from npm:

```sh
npm install -g whiskd
```

Then run:

```sh
whiskd status
```

Do not run `whiskd` via `npx github:Jeecabs/whiskd ...`. `whiskd` manages long-running processes and needs a stable local binary/path for reliable monitoring, attach, and stop behavior.

### Agent skill

Install the optional agent skill with skills.sh:

```sh
npx skills add Jeecabs/whiskd
```

### Local checkout

For local development, or if you prefer a plain `~/bin` install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jeecabs/whiskd.git
cd whiskd
./install.sh
```

Make sure `~/bin` is in your `PATH`:

```sh
export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
```

## Usage

```sh
# Run with TUI (foreground)
whiskd npm run dev

# Run in background
whiskd start npm run dev

# Named process
whiskd start --name api node server.js

# Check what's running
whiskd status
whiskd status --json

# Live running-process dashboard
whiskd top
whiskd top --global    # all directories

# View logs (last 40 lines by default)
whiskd logs
whiskd logs api 100

# Attach to a background process
whiskd attach api

# Stop
whiskd stop api
whiskd stop --all

# Clean up stopped process dirs
whiskd clean
```

## TUI keys (foreground/attach)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Kill process and exit |
| `d` | Detach (leave running in background) |
| `p` | Pause/unpause output |

## Top keys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit top |
| `↑`/`↓`/`j`/`k` | Select process |
| `Enter` / `a` | Attach to selected process |
| `s` | Stop selected process |
| `l` | View logs of selected process |
| `g` | Toggle global/local view |

## Auto-naming

Process names are derived from commands automatically:

| Command | Name |
|---------|------|
| `npm run dev` | `dev` |
| `node server.js` | `server` |
| `python app.py` | `app` |

Use `--name` / `-n` to override. The flag must come before the command, so a later `-n` belongs to the command (`whiskd start --name t tail -n 50 app.log`). An explicit name that is already running is an error; auto-derived names get a `-2` suffix instead.

## Startup failures

`whiskd start` waits ~300ms. If the command exits in that window it prints the exit reason and last output, then exits with the command's code. Crashes after that are recorded in the log footer.

## Logs

Logs are stored in `/tmp/whiskd-<uid>/<cwd-hash>/<name>/output.log` (a private, per-user directory with `0700` permissions; state files and logs are `0600`). Each process dir also records its `cwd`, which `status --json` and `top --global` report.

Upgrading from 3.x: the state layout changed, so processes started by 3.x won't show up in 4.x. Stop them with 3.x first, or kill them by pid.

Log files keep ANSI color codes; `whiskd logs` and top's log pane strip them for display, while `attach` and the foreground TUI show them raw (it's a live terminal view). The foreground TUI runs commands with `FORCE_COLOR=1`; `whiskd start` uses `FORCE_COLOR=0`.

Logs are capped at 10MB — enforced when a process exits and whenever any whiskd command runs, and checked continuously while `top` or `attach` are open. Old process dirs are pruned after 7 days. When whiskd discovers a death after the fact (the usual case for `whiskd start`), it appends an `exited (status unknown)` footer to the log.

## Command quoting

Multi-argument commands are quoted per-argument, so `whiskd echo 'a  b'` preserves the grouping your shell resolved, and env prefixes like `FOO='x y' cmd` stay assignments. A single-argument command string is passed raw to the shell:

```sh
whiskd start "npm run build && npm start"   # shell operators work
whiskd printf '%s\n' 'a b' c                # arguments survive intact
```
